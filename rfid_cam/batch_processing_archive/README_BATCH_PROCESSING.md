# Batch Processing Archive

## Overview
This directory contains the archived intelligent batch processing implementation that includes:
- OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API integration for animal identification
- 30-second delay batching system with timer-based processing
- Enhanced encounter statistics and detailed notifications
- AI-powered photo selection from multiple captures

## Status
- **AI Analysis**: ‚úÖ Working perfectly (identifies "tabby cat" correctly)
- **Batch Notifications**: ‚úÖ Working (sends enhanced SMS with AI details)  
- **Timer System**: ‚ùå Threading.Timer not executing reliably
- **Core Detection**: ‚úÖ All basic functionality working perfectly

## What Works
- Manual batch processing triggers successfully
- AI correctly identifies animals in photos
- Enhanced notifications with encounter statistics
- Photo analysis and scoring system

## Issue Identified
The `threading.Timer` objects are not executing their callbacks reliably. Possible causes:
1. Timer cancellation logic interrupting execution
2. Threading context issues in systemd service environment
3. Timer object garbage collection

## Manual Test Results (2025-10-01)
```
üìä Added detection to batch for 900263003496836
ü§ñ Triggering AI batch processing...
INFO: Processing batch of 1 detections for chip 900263003496836  
INFO: Animal identified: tabby cat
INFO: Batched notification sent for 900263003496836 (animal: tabby cat)
‚úÖ Batch processing complete!
```

## Future Implementation Ideas
1. Replace threading.Timer with time-based polling in worker thread
2. Use APScheduler for more reliable timer execution  
3. Implement batch processing as separate process/service
4. Add database persistence for batch queue
